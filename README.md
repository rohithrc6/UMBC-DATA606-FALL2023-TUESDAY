levels of the plant, respectively.
- Used Z-score analysis for anomaly detection.
- Made use of Integromat, and Twilio to send an alert message every 15 minutes whenever the light or
moisture level is below the threshold.

#### Android Application
### GPA ASSISTANT :
*07/2021*
- Developed an Android application that can calculate SGPA scores from a given set of credits and points.
